What I need to start this new year

One more year passed with a lot of failures, a lot more success stories and even more surprises. The major thing i have realized in 2017 (of course by the end of every year) is that "time passes very quickly". On looking back I have a few things to express, which are meddling in my mind while I am busy in carving my new year 2K18's resolution. 
Much hyped movie -Baahubali-2
Why Kattappa killed Baahubali??
On watching part-1 of Baahubali my expectations were very high on part-2. The only question that has omnipresence is "Why Kattappa killed Baahubali?", Both in social media and mainstream media. 
Probably this much-sought hype was grown organically but not met the expectations of the common audience who excited about later part. No doubt it's a visual wonder but missed the same height of content and screenplay.
On the whole, it created a hope that "Indian cinema can compete with Hollywood in near future".

Popular person of the year - Narendra Modi.
According to me, the most celebrated person is our prime minister Narendra Modi. His words are still resounding in my ears "a 56-inch chest" is a pre-requisite to convert India's most populous state into a developed state." which he delivered in UP to snatch victory after 14 years. Landmark GST introduced in India by his government. 
Ironically same 56-inch brave Modi feared of Acchedin and Vikas in Gujarat election campaign. Although opposition gearing up to confront him on various issues, he still enjoys popular backing from Indian electorate.

The most concerned issue in 2017- suicides of inter students.
Don't know whether my aversion towards studies or concern for humanity that made me pick up this alarming issue about the tragedic end of student lives. In today's competitive world corporate educational institutions putting undue pressure on students and “playing with their lives”. Which forcing students to end their lives. One more major reason for the spike in suicides is depression and health problems in students. Our society still doesn't take mental health seriously. Going to the psychiatrist is considered a taboo and not getting treatment for mental disorders has become a reason for student's suicides. There is an immediate need for educating parents and empowering society in this regard. There are other issues like teachers harassment, ragging and lack of sports infrastructure and extracurricular activities which makes students physically and mentally strong. Governments must chalk out a strategy in consultation with Student forums, psychiatrists and parents to curb the suicides.
